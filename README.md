# FYS3150_Project_3
Project 3 in FYS3150 Computational Physics

The objective of this project was to build a model for simulating the solar system using ordinary differential equations. Positions and velocities of celestial bodies were calculated by using Newton's gravitational law. Both Euler and Verlet was implemented and compared with each other regarding computation speed, FLOPS and relative error. It was found that the Verlet solver was superior to the Euler solver due to its high accuracy. This lead to a precise model of our solar system. The general theory of relativity was illustrated by showing the perihelion precession of Mercury.
